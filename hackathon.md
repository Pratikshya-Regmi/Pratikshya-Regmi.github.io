Participating in hackathons has allowed me to step out of my comfort zone, apply geospatial and AI knowledge in new ways, and collaborate with diverse, interdisciplinary teams.

## ðŸŒ¾ N.C. PSI Hackathon 2025

**Date:** October 2025  
**Hosted by:** N.C. Plant Sciences Initiative (NC State University)  
**Winner:** **1st Place â€“ Advanced Track** ðŸŽ‰

We built a reproducible ML pipeline linking **climate & soil variables** to **NC crop outcomes**. The sprint covered rapid EDA, feature engineering, and model comparisons (baselines â†’ **Random Forest/XGBoost**) with clear explainability to surface key drivers of yield and resilience. We wrapped results into concise visuals and takeaways for growers and researchers.

## ðŸŒ¾ N.C. PSI Hackathon 2024  
**Date:** October , 2024  
**Hosted by:** N.C. Plant Sciences Initiative (NC State University)

I had the pleasure of participating in the **2024 N.C. PSI Hackathon**, where our task was to **distinguish crops from weeds** using 400 annotated images. We worked with Roboflow to classify the data into "crop" and "weed" categories and tested multiple models â€” including **YOLO** â€” to improve prediction accuracy.

Despite having limited prior experience in crop science, I found this challenge incredibly **rewarding and educational**. It was a crash course in agricultural AI and teamwork under pressure, and I walked away with new skills, insights, and a lot of appreciation for the intersection of machine learning and geospatial analytics.
