# ðŸ§  Hackathons & Challenges

Participating in hackathons has allowed me to step out of my comfort zone, apply geospatial and AI knowledge in new ways, and collaborate with diverse, interdisciplinary teams.

## ðŸŒ¾ N.C. PSI Hackathon 2024  
**Dates:** October 18â€“20, 2024  
**Hosted by:** N.C. Plant Sciences Initiative (NC State University)

I had the pleasure of participating in the **2024 N.C. PSI Hackathon**, where our task was to **distinguish crops from weeds** using 400 annotated images. We worked with Roboflow to classify the data into "crop" and "weed" categories and tested multiple models â€” including **YOLO** â€” to improve prediction accuracy.

Despite having limited prior experience in crop science, I found this challenge incredibly **rewarding and educational**. It was a crash course in agricultural AI and teamwork under pressure, and I walked away with new skills, insights, and a lot of appreciation for the intersection of machine learning and geospatial analytics.
