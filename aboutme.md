My name is Pratikshya Regmi. I bring together the analytical precision of a geospatial scientist with the curiosity of a lifelong learner. Here’s what I bring to the table:

- I fuse LiDAR and UAV data to solve real-world geospatial challenges  
- I build AI-powered geospatial tools (yes, including my own GIS chatbot!)  
- I’ve presented at international conferences and led workshops  
- I’m an FAA-certified drone pilot who’s just as comfortable in the field as I am in front of a whiteboard


### My Story

I’m a Ph.D. student at the Center for Geospatial Analytics, NC State University, where I focus on developing innovative methods to accurately model terrain by fusing LiDAR and UAS datasets. My work bridges high-resolution geospatial data with machine learning and open-source tools like GRASS GIS to support better decision-making for environmental and disaster resilience.

Before this, I completed my master's in Geospatial Engineering from Texas A & M University - Corpus Christi.
I believe in the power of open science, collaboration, and mentoring the next generation of geospatial thinkers. Whether I’m working on hydrological simulations or helping students understand spatial point patterns, I bring passion and precision to everything I do.
