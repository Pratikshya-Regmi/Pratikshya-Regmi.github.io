title: 🌟 Outreach & STEM Engagement

---

Giving back to the community through **STEM education, youth engagement, and volunteering** has been a meaningful part of my academic journey. Whether mentoring future scientists, showcasing interactive technologies, or judging creative science fair projects, each experience has inspired me just as much as I hope to inspire others.

## 🚀 STEM Resource Fair for K-12 Students with Disabilities  
**Years:** 2024 & 2025  
**Theme:** *Reach for the Stars — Be a Star*  

Two years in a row, I participated in this empowering event designed to spark scientific curiosity among K-12 students with disabilities. I engaged students with hands-on demos and conversations about geospatial science and drone mapping, showing how science is for everyone — and how anyone can be a star in STEM!

## 🧠 Olds Elementary Science & Engineering Fair – Judge  
**Year:** 2025  
**Grades:** 3rd–5th  

It was an incredible honor to volunteer as a judge for the annual science fair at Olds Elementary School. I was truly amazed by the **creativity and intelligence** these young scientists brought to the table. Their projects included thoughtful research questions, methodical testing, and compelling presentations — all at such a young age! Their critical thinking and clarity left me in awe.

## 🌿 Summer Science Camp – Tangible Landscape Showcase  
**Year:** 2024  
**Location:** NC State University  

One of my most rewarding outreach moments came during this camp where I showcased the **Tangible Landscape system**. Middle schoolers used this hands-on modeling tool to solve an environmental problem:  

> "How do we reduce phosphate runoff in a farm simulation of eastern North Carolina?"  

They designed solutions using **retention ponds** and **vegetation buffers**, physically modifying the sand table and watching the simulation results update in real time. Hearing the students say this was their favorite part of the camp made the experience unforgettable!

## 🌐 CEETLE Education – Teaching Assistant  
**Dates:** Dec 2020 – Feb 2021  
**Location:** Virtual (Nepal)  
**Organization:** School of Applied Software Engineering and Leadership  

During this international outreach project, I taught **data science and machine learning fundamentals** using real-time streaming data from **Array of Things (AoT) sensors**. These lessons were tailored for high school students in Nepal who had strong motivation to learn but lacked access to resources. Supporting their curiosity and growth was both humbling and inspiring.

## 💫 Why Outreach Matters

Every interaction — whether with elementary schoolers building vinegar volcanoes or high schoolers coding ML models — reinforces my belief that science thrives when it's inclusive, hands-on, and inspiring. I will continue to advocate for accessible STEM education and share the tools and technologies that have shaped my own journey.
